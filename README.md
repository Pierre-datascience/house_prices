# From data exploration to ridge regression, a complete guide for the Kaggle House Prices competition.

This notebook shows a thorough approach to the House Prices competition, from data exploration to modelling and final predictions. Here I focused on the clarity of each step of the process, and chose to use simple models to emphasize the importance of the data analysis and the feature engineering stages. Using a simple ridge regression allowed me to score in the top 20% on the public leaderboard.
